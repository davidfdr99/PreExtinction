### Introduction


As part of the D4GEN Hackathon held at the Genopole from March 31st to April 2nd, 2023, our team developed the PreExtinction model.

Our objective is to predict the conservation status of unlabelled species to provide guidance for biodiversity policies and resource allocation.

During the Hackathon, we focused on producing a proof of concept for the Mollusca phylum. Mollusca is not only the largest marine phylum but also the second-largest phylum of invertebrate animals. Despite being a crucial pillar of ecosystems, the endangerment of this phylum is often neglected.


### Objective

The objective of the project was to create a database with multile APIs to predict the endangerment of species. Our MVP predicts in two classes 'least concerned' and 'endangered' unlabelled species of the Mollusca phylum.
